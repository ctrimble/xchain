      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>Welcome to the skinning 5-minute tutorial. We'll walk through step by step and get you up and rolling with XChain's skinning.</p>
      <p>By now you've gone through a few of the other tutorials and so probably know how to work with some of the features that XChain's provides. Since you're familiar with how the files work lets jump right in. <em>Open up the skins/index.xhtml file.</em></p>
      <p>You should see the code below at the top of the document.</p>
      <code>
        &lt;!-- <br />
        &lt;?skin system-id="resource://servlet-context/skins/base.xhtml"?&gt;<br />
        --&gt;
      </code>
