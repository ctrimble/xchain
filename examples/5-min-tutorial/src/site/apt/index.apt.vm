{Creating a tutorial application from this archetype}

  A copy of this application can be created using the maven archetype plugin.  To create the copy, run the following command:

+--------------------------+
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=${archetypeGroupId} -DarchetypeArtifactId=${archetypeArtifactId} -DarchetypeVersion=${archetypeVersion}
+--------------------------+

  Once this command has been executed, you will be prompted for some variables.  Enter in the following values:

+--------------------------+
Define value for groupId: : ${projectGroupId}
Define value for artifactId: : ${projectArtifactId}
Define value for version:  ${projectVersion}: : ${projectVersion}
Define value for package:  ${projectGroupId}: : ${projectGroupId}
+--------------------------+

  Then answer "Y" when promted with:

+--------------------------+
 Y: :
+--------------------------+

  The archetype will be created in the directory tutorial.  You can then change the working directory to tutorial and build the example using:

+--------------------------+
cd ${projectArtifactId}
mvn clean install
+--------------------------+

  Now the tutorial war will be available for deploy from the target directory.  Changes to any files in the archetype will be reflected in the deployed application, so there is no need to recompile the application when doing work, unless you update java source files.

{Building the archetype for this tutorial}

  This applications pom defines configuration for the archetype:create-from-project mojo.  You can build an archetype from this project using the following steps:

+--------------------------+
mvn clean archetype:create-from-project
cd target/generated-sources/archetype
mvn clean install
+--------------------------+

  Once this is done, an archetype that creates new tutorial apps will be created.
